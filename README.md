SQL Queries:
Consider the given Database Schema: for problem statement 1 1. Dept (Deptno, Name, Location, Managerempid)
2. Employees
(name, empid, address,
city, dob,
date_of_joining,gender, salary, deptno)
Gender must take value 'M' or 'F'.
3. Project(Projectid, title,city).
4. Works (empid, Projectid, total_hrs_worked);
5. Dependant(empid, name_of_dependant, age, relation) Primary Key is underlined.
Projects are 'Banking Project', 'Testing Project', 'ERP system'. 'Software management' etc
Consider departments as""Development". "Testing", "Planning", "Service", "Administration" etc
Consider Locations for department as "Building 1", "Building 2", "Building 3", "Main building"
employee id will start as 101 to 300
1. Develop DDL to implement the above schema enforcing primary key, check constraints (F and M for gender) and foreign key constraints.
2. Insert data in each table.
3. Develop DML to Populate Database
4. Add column Mobile number in employee table
5. Update mobile numbers for each employee.
6. "Testing Project"is cancelled so delete that entry from project
7. Develop a SQL query to list employees having name starting with 'S'
8. Develop a SQL query to list department having location 'Building 1'
9. Develop a SQL query to list employee having joining year 2019 to 2020
10. Develop a SQL query to display all employees having
salary > 50000
11. Develop a SQL query to display all projects of "Pune" 12. Develop a SQL query to display all dependants of
employee id 102
13. Develop a SQL query to display all manager names 14. Develop a SQL query to find the age of all employees 15. Display all employees in descending order of age
